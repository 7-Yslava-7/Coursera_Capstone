## Peer-graded Assignment: Car Accident Severity


_Tim Yslava_  
 

Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, 
over the course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to 
leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a 
problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve.


## 1) Introduction/Business Problem

Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to 
solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of 
stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about 
your problem.

**_In this research project I hope to provide a definitive answer to the conditions and locations that correlate most closely with severe car accidents. People like car and tire manufactures, local municipalities, and individual drivers would have a deep interest in the findings of this project._**

## 2) Downloading and Prepping Data

Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use 
the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in 
combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, 
with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

**_To provide the stakeholders the necessary information, I'll be leveraging data from these websites:_**
